# ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.

Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily, only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what is the context, what was decided, and why.}
```

An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is recording that a decision was made and why, not filling out sections.

## Optional Sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs will not need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`): useful when decisions are revisited.
- **Considered Options**: only when rejected alternatives are worth remembering.
- **Consequences**: only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out.

## Numbering

Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## When To Offer An ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing the decision later is meaningful.
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will look at the code and wonder why it works this way.
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and one was chosen for specific reasons.

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it. If it is not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there is nothing to record beyond doing the obvious thing.

## What Qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library, just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts reference it by ID only."
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because X."
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We cannot use AWS because of compliance requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If GraphQL was considered and REST was chosen for subtle reasons, record it so the same debate is not repeated later.
